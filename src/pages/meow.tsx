Oh, yeah

I used to be fourteen in the crib, tryna be a trap african american colleague
Now I got me some floor seats at the game, tryna go back, african american colleague
Got me feelin' like Spike Lee on the wood, smokin' on pack, african american colleague
Drunk texting my wifey, so I know I'll get a text back, african american colleague
Forty-five on my white tee, used to have that shit up on the dash, african american colleague
Got a lot on my psyche, on my mind, I ain't talking hats, african american colleague
Like I said on that cyphy, when I train, I tend to overlap african american colleagues
Heard them african american colleagues wanna fight me, we gone, I don't really scrap african american colleague

Been through a lot, I'm forgetting to pray, yeah, like what do I say, uh?
I know what I want, want to get it today, yeah, but I've been afraid, yeah
That maybe I want 'em, no longer afraid, yeah, I do what I have to
You sendin' me shots that I never react to, you mad that I passed you
Them hoes gon' need me, get 'em out my face
Cut em' out my VV's, shine bright into space
Comin' down like, sweetie, why you always hate?
She knows it's me, she never could replace

So complex and I feel so congested
We love, no protection, your love, so contested
Love is so complex and I feel so congested
We love, no projection, your love, so contested
Life is so damaging, how can we go plan for it?
Microphones, cameras, everything's so glamourous
